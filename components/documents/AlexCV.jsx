            My Mechatronics Engineering degree provided a multidisciplinary
            foundation in mechanics, materials, electrical and electronics
            engineering, control systems, and low-level programming. This
            expanded my expertise in mechanical design to include
            microcontrollers and electronics. I further specialised by selecting
            advanced electives in mechanical vibration and signal processing,
            leveraging their mathematical overlap with core control subjects.
